How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
- Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable requires a large amount of plaining an for thought before you even start writing code. It also helps to have a full stack understanding of the dependices you have such as a database in this example.
- The CRUD interface build for this project to quickly be addapted to handle othe Mongo databases leading to a quicker turnaround for future products.
  
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
- The approch I took for this project compared to previous assignments was with this project I had most of the pieces and the main objective was to bring the pieces together much like I would have to do in many large projects going forward.
- Following the CRUD setup to create the four actions a database needs to operate will help me build future database interfaces.
  
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
- Computer scientists design and develop software and hardware to solve and problem that has a need to be fixed. This class we saw the design of a full stack application that helps visualize animal adoption data.
- This will incease the speed of the employees at Grazioso Salvare filter through there data to better support there needs.
